            This web application helps viewers visualize the non-linear timeline of the TV show by
            organizing events chronologically based on when they occur in the story, rather than
            when they air.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">How It Works</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each event has a time offset (delta) from "time zero" in the story. Events can be
            flashbacks (negative deltas) or flash-forwards (positive deltas). The timeline displays
            all events in chronological order with time progression indicators between them.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Spoiler Protection</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            To avoid spoilers, you can set your viewing progress (season and episode). Events from
            episodes you haven't watched yet will be blurred out. You can reveal individual events
            by clicking the "Reveal This Event" button on any blurred event.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">Open Source</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            This project stores all event data in a human-readable JSON file that's version
            controlled. Anyone can view the data on GitHub and contribute corrections or additions.
