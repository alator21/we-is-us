            The initial intention of this application was to display a timeline of the various
            important Pluribus events. In my opinion, that would be interesting if there was a lot
            of back and forth, so us viewers could have a better understanding of the plot. I think,
            that the plot is mostly linear and thus i'm not sure if it makes sense to keep
            maintaining it. I will still accept contributions on GitHub though.
